     If M≤10, the grade will be E. 
     If 11≥M≤20, the grade will be D. 
     If 21≥M≤30, the grade will be C. 
     If 31≥M≤40, the grade will be B. 
     If 41≥M≤50, the grade will be A. 
    Your friend will enter his marks out of 5050, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement. 
    Note: You have to complete findGrades function. No need to take any input. 
    Input Format 
    The first and the only line of the input contain an integer M, representing the marks that your friend will enter in the grading system. 
    Output Format 
    Return the grade obtained by your friend. 
    Constraints 
    0≤M≤50 
    Example 
    Sample Input 
    1 
    Sample Output 
    E
   </pre>
   <h3>Q2. Get Value </h3>
   <pre>
    You are provided with a table containing some characters and their corresponding values. 
    Your task will be to find the value from the 
    table corresponding to an input character and return it. 
    | P or p - PrepBytes | 
    | Z or z - Zenith |  
    | E or e - Expert Coder |  
    | D or d - Data Structure | 
    Note: You have to complete getValue function. No need to take any input. 
    Input Format 
    The first and the only line of the input contain a character C, representing the character that you will get in input. 
    Output Format 
    Return the value corresponding to the input character. 
    Constraints 
    C will be one of the following characters: [P, p, Z, z, E, e, D, d]. 
    Example 
    Sample Input 
    E 
    Sample Output 
    Expert Coder
